      The sleep interval **`in seconds`** between scans.

      Default: **`10` seconds**.


      Allows a lease manager implementation to specify to PartitionManager how
      often it should

      scan leases and renew them. In order to redistribute leases in a timely
      fashion after a host

      ceases operating, we recommend a relatively short interval, such as ten
      seconds. Obviously it

      should be less than half of the lease length, to prevent accidental
      expiration.


      If `Leasemanager` is provided when creating the EventProcessorHost then
      this value will be ignored.
