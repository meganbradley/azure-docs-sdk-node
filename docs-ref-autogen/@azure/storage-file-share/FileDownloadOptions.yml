      How many retries will perform when original body download stream
      unexpected ends.

      Above kind of ends will not trigger retry policy defined in a pipeline,

      because they doesn't emit network errors.


      With this option, every additional retry means an additional
      ShareFileClient.download() request will be made

      from the broken point, until the requested range has been successfully
      downloaded or maxRetryRequests is reached.


      Default value is 5, please set a larger value when loading large files in
      poor network.
