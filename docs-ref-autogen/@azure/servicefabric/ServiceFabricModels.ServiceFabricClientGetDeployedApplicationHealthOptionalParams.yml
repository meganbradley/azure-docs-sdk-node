    summary: >-
      Allows filtering of the deployed service package health state objects
      returned in the result

      of deployed application health query based on their health state.

      The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the
      following health

      states.

      Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. All
      deployed service

      packages are used to evaluate the aggregated health state of the deployed
      application.

      If not specified, all entries are returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value can be a
      combination of these

      values, obtained using the bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of service
      packages with HealthState

      value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.


      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.
