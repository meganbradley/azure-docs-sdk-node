      A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.

      A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which
      forwards to the health

      store.

      If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP
      Gateway to the health

      store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway
      Application is using.

      This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as
      possible.

      Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still
      fail, for example if

      the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.

      If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health
      client settings from the

      HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the
      HealthReportSendInterval

      configuration.

      This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to
      optimize health

      reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.

      By default, reports are not sent immediately. Default value: false.
