      A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
      strings. The list is

      in decreasing order of preference. For additional information, including
      expected format, see

      [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
      header and the setLang

      query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set
      this header, you must

      also specify the cc query parameter. Bing will use the first supported
      language it finds from

      the list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to
      determine the market to

      return results for. If the list does not include a supported language,
      Bing will find the

      closest language and market that supports the request, and may use an
      aggregated or default

      market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this
      header and the cc query

      parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should
      use the mkt and

      setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used
      as a label in a user

      interface. There are very few user interface strings in the JSON response
      objects. Any links

      in the response objects to Bing.com properties will apply the specified
      language.

    summary: >-
      Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across
      Bing API calls. Bing

      often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as
      a key for assigning

      traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
      user across multiple

      requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights.
      Being assigned to

      multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
      For example, if the

      second request has a different flight assignment than the first, the
      experience may be

      unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
      client ID’s search

      history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this
      header to help

      improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client
      ID. The relevance

      improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs
      and in turn enables

      higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
      optional, you should

      consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple
      requests for the same

      end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
      consistent user

      experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of
      results from the Bing

      APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a
      unique, Bing generated

      client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
      generates an ID and returns

      it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
      NOT include this

      header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that
      device. Use the client ID

      for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device.
      Persist the client

      ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to
      ensure the ID is used

      across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
      mobile apps, use the

      device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
      your app on that

      device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may
      not include this

      header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and
      use it for all

      subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
      X-MSEdge-ClientID,

      you must not include cookies in the request.

      The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to

      behavior. Although

      optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
      X-Search-Location header.

      Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to
      0). Obfuscating the

      address results in the location not being anywhere near the device's
      actual location, which

      may result in Bing serving erroneous results.

      This API supports only

      the United States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be
      set to us. If you

      uses the first

      supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
      language with the

      country code that you specify to determine the market to return results
      for. If the languages

      list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest
      language and market that

      supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
      the results instead of

      a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the

      A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
      geographical

      location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search
      behavior and to return

      relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
      following are the

      keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
      latitude of the client's

      location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0
      and less than or

      equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive
      values indicate

      northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's
      location, in degrees. The

      longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal
      to +180.0. Negative

      values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
      longitudes. re

      (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy
      of the coordinates.

      Pass the value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
      might be 22m for

      GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
      lookup. ts

      (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
      (The UNIX timestamp

      is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The
      client's relative

      heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
      from 0 through 360,

      counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
      key is nonzero. sp

      (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that
      the client device is

      traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters.
      are (optional): The

      radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the
      coordinates. Specify this key

      only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional,
      the more information

      that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
      optional, you are

      encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing
      the location is

      especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately
      reflect the user's

      physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal
      results, you should

      include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum,
      you should include

      this header.
