      Boolean flag for enabling gender-neutral captioning for Caption and Dense
      Captions features.

      By default captions may contain gender terms (for example: 'man', 'woman',
      or 'boy', 'girl').

      If you set this to "true", those will be replaced with gender-neutral
      terms (for example: 'person' or 'child').

    summary: >-
      The version of cloud AI-model used for analysis.

      The format is the following: 'latest' (default value) or 'YYYY-MM-DD' or
      'YYYY-MM-DD-preview', where 'YYYY', 'MM', 'DD' are the year, month and day
      associated with the model.

      This is not commonly set, as the default always gives the latest AI model
      with recent improvements.

      If however you would like to make sure analysis results do not change over
      time, set this value to a specific model version.

      A list of aspect ratios to use for smart cropping.

      Aspect ratios are calculated by dividing the target crop width in pixels
      by the height in pixels.

      Supported values are between 0.75 and 1.8 (inclusive).

      If this parameter is not specified, the service will return one crop
      region with an aspect

      ratio it sees fit between 0.5 and 2.0 (inclusive).
