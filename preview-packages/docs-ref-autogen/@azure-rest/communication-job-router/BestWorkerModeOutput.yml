      Define a scoring rule to use, when calculating a score to determine the
      best worker. If not set, will use a default scoring formula that uses the
      number of job labels that the worker labels match, as well as the number
      of label selectors the worker labels match and/or exceed using a logistic
      function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).

      If set to true, then router will match workers to jobs even if they don't
      match label selectors. Warning: You may get workers that are not qualified
      for a job they are matched with if you set this variable to true. This
      flag is intended more for temporary usage. By default, set to false.
