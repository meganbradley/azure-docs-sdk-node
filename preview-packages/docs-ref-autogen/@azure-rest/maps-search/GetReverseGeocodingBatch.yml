      **Reverse Geocoding Batch API**



      **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




      The Reverse Geocoding Batch API sends batches of queries to [Reverse
      Geocoding
      API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding)
      using just a single API call. The API allows caller to batch up to **100**
      queries.


      ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

      The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When
      the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items
      are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results
      later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if
      the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is
      limited to **100** for this API.

      ```

      POST
      https://atlas.microsoft.com/reverseGeocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01

      ```

      ### POST Body for Batch Request

      To send the _reverse geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request
      where the request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json`
      format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`.
      Here's a sample request body containing 2 _reverse geocoding_ queries:



      ```

      {
        "batchItems": [
          {
            "coordinates": [-122.128275, 47.639429],
            "resultTypes": ["Address", "PopulatedPlace"]
          },
          {
            "coordinates": [-122.341979399674, 47.6095253501216]
          }
        ]
      }

      ```


      A _reverse geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported
      _reverse geocoding_ [URI
      parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding#uri-parameters).



      The batch should contain at least **1** query.



      ### Batch Response Model

      The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
      `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
      `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The
      batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a
      response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems`
      will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were
      sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:

        - [`GeocodingResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed successfully.

        - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
