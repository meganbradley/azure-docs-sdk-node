  **Reverse Geocoding Batch API**



  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




  The Reverse Geocoding Batch API sends batches of queries to [Reverse Geocoding
  API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding)
  using just a single API call. The API allows caller to batch up to **100**
  queries.


  ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

  The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the
  service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are
  calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The
  Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request
  takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100**
  for this API.

  ```

  POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/reverseGeocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01

  ```

  ### POST Body for Batch Request

  To send the _reverse geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where
  the request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the
  `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample
  request body containing 2 _reverse geocoding_ queries:



  ```

  {
    "batchItems": [
      {
        "coordinates": [-122.128275, 47.639429],
        "resultTypes": ["Address", "PopulatedPlace"]
      },
      {
        "coordinates": [-122.341979399674, 47.6095253501216]
      }
    ]
  }

  ```


  A _reverse geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported
  _reverse geocoding_ [URI
  parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding#uri-parameters).



  The batch should contain at least **1** query.



  ### Batch Response Model

  The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
  `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
  `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch
  response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each
  and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the
  results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
  request. Each item is of one of the following types:

    - [`GeocodingResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-reverse-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed successfully.

    - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
