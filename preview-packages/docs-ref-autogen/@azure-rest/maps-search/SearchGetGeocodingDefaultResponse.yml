  **Geocoding**


  **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if
  you are only interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed
  for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the
  geocoding endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The
  geocoding search index will be queried for everything above the street level
  data. No Point of Interest (POIs) will be returned. Note that the geocoder is
  very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle
  everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well as
  higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.
