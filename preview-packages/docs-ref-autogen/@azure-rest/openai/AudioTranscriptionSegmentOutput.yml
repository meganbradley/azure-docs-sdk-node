  Extended information about a single segment of transcribed audio data.

  Segments generally represent roughly 5-10 seconds of speech. Segment
  boundaries typically occur between words but not

  necessarily sentences.

      The seek position associated with the processing of this audio segment.

      Seek positions are expressed as hundredths of seconds.

      The model may process several segments from a single seek position, so
      while the seek position will never represent

      a later time than the segment's start, the segment's start may represent a
      significantly later time than the

      segment's associated seek position.
