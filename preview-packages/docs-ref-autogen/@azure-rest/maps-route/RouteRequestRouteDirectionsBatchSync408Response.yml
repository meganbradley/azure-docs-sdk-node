  **Route Directions Batch API**



  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




  The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
  API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using
  just a single API call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either
  asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to
  batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.

  ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

  The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the
  service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are
  calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The
  Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request
  takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100**
  for this API.

  ```

  ### Batch Response Model

  The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When
  downloading the results of an async batch request, if the batch has finished
  processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
  contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were
  part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which
  were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems`
  array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request.
  The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original
  queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains
  `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one
  of the following types:

    - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the query completed successfully.

    - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.


  Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
