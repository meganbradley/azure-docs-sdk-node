      **Route Directions Batch API**



      **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




      The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route
      Directions
      API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections)
      using just a single API call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to
      run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
      allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100**
      queries.

      ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

      The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When
      the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items
      are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results
      later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if
      the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is
      limited to **100** for this API.

      ```

      POST

      ```

      ### Batch Response Model

      The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When
      downloading the results of an async batch request, if the batch has
      finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This
      batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
      `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
      `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The
      batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a
      response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems`
      will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were
      sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode`
      and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
      following types:

        - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the query completed successfully.

        - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.


      Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
