  Interface that describes the functions to be implemented by the user which are
  invoked by

  the `EventHubConsumerClient` when the `subscribe()` method is called to
  receive events

  from Event Hub.

    summary: >-
      The function invoked by `EventHubConsumerClient` each time the
      subscription stops reading events from

      a partition. The information on this partition will be available on the
      `PartitionContext` passed to the

      function `processClose`.


      If the `CloseReason` passed to this function is `OwnershipLost`, then
      another subscription has taken over

      reading from the same partition using the same consumer group. This is
      expected if you have multiple

      instances of your application running and have passed the
      `CheckpointStore` to the client to load balance.


      If the `CloseReason` is `Shutdown`, this indicates that either
      `subscription.close()` was called, or an

      error occured. Unless the subscription was explicitly closed via
      `subscription.close()`, the subscription

      will attempt to resume reading events from the last checkpoint for the
      partition.

    summary: >-
      The function invoked by `EventHubConsumerClient` for errors that occur
      when receiving events

      or when executing any of the user provided functions passed to the
      `subscribe()` method.


      The `PartitionContext` passed to this function will indicate the partition
      that was being processed

      when the error was thrown. In cases where an error is thrown outside of
      processing events from a

      partition(e.g. failure to perform load balancing), the `partitionId` on
      the context will be an empty string.


      After the client completes executing this function, the `partitionClose`
      function is invoked.

    package: '@azure/event-hubs'
    summary: >-
      The function invoked by `EventHubConsumerClient` when a set of events is
      received. The

      `PartitionContext` passed to this function can be used to determine which
      partition is being read from.


      The `updateCheckpoint()` method on the context can be used to update
      checkpoints in the `CheckpointStore`

      (if one was provided to the client). Use this in frequent intervals to
      mark events that have been processed

      so that the client can restart from such checkpoints in the event of a
      restart or error recovery.


      Note: It is possible for received events to be an empty array.

      This can happen if there are no new events to receive

      in the `maxWaitTimeInSeconds`, which is defaulted to 60 seconds.

      The `maxWaitTimeInSeconds` can be changed by setting

      it in the `options` passed to `subscribe()`.

    summary: >-
      The function invoked by `EventHubConsumerClient` each time the
      subscription is about to begin

      reading from a partition. The `PartitionContext` passed to this function
      can be used to determine

      which partition is about to be read from.


      The client will start receiving events for the partition only after
      completing the execution of

      this function (if provided). Therefore, use this function to carry out any
      setup work including

      async tasks.
