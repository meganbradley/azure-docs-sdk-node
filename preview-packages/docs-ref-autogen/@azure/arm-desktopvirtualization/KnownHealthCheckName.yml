  - name: AppAttachHealthCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.AppAttachHealthCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies that the AppAttachService is healthy (there were no issues during
      package staging). The AppAttachService is used to enable the
      staging/registration (and eventual deregistration/destaging) of MSIX apps
      that have been set up by the tenant admin. This checks whether the
      component had any failures during package staging. Failures in staging
      will prevent some MSIX apps from working properly for the end user. If
      this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service
      connections, main issue may be certain apps will not work for end-users.
      (Currently Enabled)
  - name: DomainJoinedCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.DomainJoinedCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the SessionHost is joined to a domain. If this check fails is
      classified as fatal as no connection can succeed if the SessionHost is not
      joined to the domain. (Currently Enabled)
  - name: DomainReachable
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.DomainReachable'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the domain the SessionHost is joined to is still reachable. If
      this check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can succeed if
      the domain the SessionHost is joined is not reachable at the time of
      connection. (Currently Disabled)
  - name: DomainTrustCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.DomainTrustCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the SessionHost is not experiencing domain trust issues that will
      prevent authentication on SessionHost at connection time when session is
      created. If this check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can
      succeed if we cannot reach the domain for authentication on the
      SessionHost. (Currently Enabled)
  - name: FSLogixHealthCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.FSLogixHealthCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the FSLogix service is up and running to make sure users'
      profiles are loaded in the session. If this check fails is classified as
      fatal as even if the connection can succeed, user experience is bad as the
      user profile cannot be loaded and user will get a temporary profile in the
      session. (Currently Disabled)
  - name: MetaDataServiceCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.MetaDataServiceCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the metadata service is accessible and return compute properties.
      (Currently Enabled)
  - name: MonitoringAgentCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.MonitoringAgentCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies that the required Geneva agent is running. If this check fails,
      it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue
      may be that monitoring agent is missing or running (possibly) older
      version. (Currently Enabled)
  - name: SupportedEncryptionCheck
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.SupportedEncryptionCheck
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies the value of SecurityLayer registration key. If the value is 0
      (SecurityLayer.RDP) this check fails with Error code =
      NativeMethodErrorCode.E_FAIL and is fatal. If the value is 1
      (SecurityLayer.Negotiate) this check fails with Error code =
      NativeMethodErrorCode.ERROR_SUCCESS and is non fatal. (Currently Disabled)
  - name: SxSStackListenerCheck
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.SxSStackListenerCheck
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies that the SxS stack is up and running so connections can succeed.
      If this check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can succeed if
      the SxS stack is not ready. (Currently Enabled)
  - name: UrlsAccessibleCheck
    uid: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.UrlsAccessibleCheck'
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies that the required WVD service and Geneva URLs are reachable from
      the SessionHost. These URLs are: RdTokenUri, RdBrokerURI, RdDiagnosticsUri
      and storage blob URLs for agent monitoring (geneva). If this check fails,
      it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue
      may be that monitoring agent is unable to store warm path data (logs,
      operations ...). (Currently Disabled)
  - name: WebRTCRedirectorCheck
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName.WebRTCRedirectorCheck
    package: '@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization'
    summary: >-
      Verifies whether the WebRTCRedirector component is healthy. The
      WebRTCRedirector component is used to optimize video and audio performance
      in Microsoft Teams. This checks whether the component is still running,
      and whether there is a higher version available. If this check fails, it
      is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may
      be the WebRTCRedirector component has to be restarted or updated.
