      Boot Diagnostics is a debugging feature which allows you to view Console
      Output and Screenshot to diagnose VM status. **NOTE**: If storageUri is
      being specified then ensure that the storage account is in the same region
      and subscription as the VM. You can easily view the output of your console
      log. Azure also enables you to see a screenshot of the VM from the
      hypervisor.
