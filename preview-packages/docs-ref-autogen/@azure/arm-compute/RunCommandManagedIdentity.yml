### YamlMime:TSType
name: RunCommandManagedIdentity
uid: '@azure/arm-compute.RunCommandManagedIdentity'
package: '@azure/arm-compute'
summary: >-
  Contains clientId or objectId (use only one, not both) of a user-assigned
  managed identity that has access to storage blob used in Run Command. Use an
  empty RunCommandManagedIdentity object in case of system-assigned identity.
  Make sure the Azure storage blob exists in case of scriptUri, and managed
  identity has been given access to blob's container with 'Storage Blob Data
  Reader' role assignment with scriptUri blob and 'Storage Blob Data
  Contributor' for Append blobs(outputBlobUri, errorBlobUri). In case of user
  assigned identity, make sure you add it under VM's identity. For more info on
  managed identity and Run Command, refer https://aka.ms/ManagedIdentity and
  https://aka.ms/RunCommandManaged.
