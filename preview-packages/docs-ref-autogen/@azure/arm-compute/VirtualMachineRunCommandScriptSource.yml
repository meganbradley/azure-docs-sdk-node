      User-assigned managed identity that has access to scriptUri in case of
      Azure storage blob. Use an empty object in case of system-assigned
      identity. Make sure the Azure storage blob exists, and managed identity
      has been given access to blob's container with 'Storage Blob Data Reader'
      role assignment. In case of user-assigned identity, make sure you add it
      under VM's identity. For more info on managed identity and Run Command,
      refer https://aka.ms/ManagedIdentity and https://aka.ms/RunCommandManaged.
