      A value that controls how many completions will be internally generated

      formulation.

      When used together with n, best_of controls the number of candidate
      completions and must be

      greater than n.

      Because this setting can generate many completions, it may quickly consume
      your token quota.

      Use carefully and ensure reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.
