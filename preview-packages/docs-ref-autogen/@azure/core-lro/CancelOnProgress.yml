  CancelOnProgress is used as the return value of a Poller's onProgress method.

  When a user invokes onProgress, they're required to pass in a function that
  will be

  called as a callback with the new data received each time the poll operation
  is updated.

  onProgress returns a function that will prevent any further update to reach
  the original callback.
