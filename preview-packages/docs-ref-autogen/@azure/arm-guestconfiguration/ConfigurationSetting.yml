    summary: >-
      Set this to true to automatically reboot the node after a configuration
      that requires reboot is applied. Otherwise, you will have to manually
      reboot the node for any configuration that requires it. The default value
      is false. To use this setting when a reboot condition is enacted by
      something other than DSC (such as Windows Installer), combine this setting
      with the xPendingReboot module.
